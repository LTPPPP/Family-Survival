## üìù Coding Standards

### C# Code Style

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PlayerController`)
  - Methods: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UpdateHealth()`)
  - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `playerSpeed`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)
  - Private fields: `_camelCase` (e.g., `_isAlive`)

- **Code Organization**:
  - Use regions to group related code
  - Keep methods focused and small (< 20 lines when possible)
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Add XML documentation for public methods

### Unity Specific Guidelines

- **Prefabs**: Name prefabs descriptively and organize in appropriate folders
- **Scenes**: Keep scenes organized with proper hierarchy
- **Scripts**: Place scripts in appropriate folders under `Assets/Scripts/`
- **Assets**: Follow the existing folder structure

### Example Code Style

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

namespace FamilySurvival.Character
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Handles player character movement and basic interactions
    /// </summary>
    public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
    {
        #region Serialized Fields
        [SerializeField] private float _moveSpeed = 5f;
        [SerializeField] private Transform _playerTransform;
        #endregion

        #region Private Fields
        private bool _isMoving;
        private Vector2 _moveDirection;
        #endregion

        #region Unity Lifecycle
        private void Start()
        {
            Initialize();
        }

        private void Update()
        {
            HandleInput();
            UpdateMovement();
        }
        #endregion

        #region Private Methods
        private void Initialize()
        {
            // Initialization logic
        }

        private void HandleInput()
        {
            // Input handling logic
        }
        #endregion
    }
}
```
